ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
===================

This assignment demonstrates the practical application of graph data structures and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms through a real-world autonomous vehicle route planning system. The solution models a regional gas station network as an undirected graph, using the standard Bag Abstract Data Type (ADT) for adjacency list representation and implementing BFS for optimal route discovery and network analysis.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================

Modern autonomous vehicles require sophisticated route planning systems to ensure safe, efficient operation. This system addresses the critical need for intelligent fuel/charging station route planning by modeling gas stations as vertices in an undirected graph connected by direct driving routes (edges). The system must provide:

1. Optimal route planning between any two gas stations
2. Emergency fuel location services within specified search radius
3. Network connectivity analysis for safety assurance
4. Fleet distribution optimization for ride-sharing services
